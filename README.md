Project Introduction
ShopEase is a cutting-edge GenAI-powered virtual agent system that revolutionizes e-commerce customer service through intelligent voice interactions. This project demonstrates the seamless integration of WebRTC technology with fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to create an AI-driven Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system specifically designed for e-commerce platforms.

Project Overview
ShopEase addresses the growing demand for scalable, intelligent customer service solutions in the e-commerce domain. The system mimics traditional IVR call services while leveraging advanced AI capabilities to provide 24/7 automated customer support with human-like conversational abilities. By combining real-time voice communication through WebRTC with domain-specific LLM fine-tuning, ShopEase delivers personalized customer experiences that can handle thousands of inquiries simultaneously.

Core Problem Statement
Modern e-commerce platforms face overwhelming customer service demands, with queries ranging from order tracking to product information and return processing. Traditional support systems often result in long wait times and inconsistent service quality. ShopEase solves this challenge by implementing an AI-powered virtual agent that provides instant, accurate, and contextually relevant responses while maintaining the natural flow of human conversation.

Key Features & Capabilities
Intelligent Voice Processing: The system processes customer voice inputs through WebRTC, converting speech to text, processing queries through fine-tuned LLMs, and delivering natural-sounding responses via text-to-speech synthesis.

E-commerce Domain Specialization: The LLM has been specifically fine-tuned to handle common e-commerce scenarios including order tracking, product inquiries, return processing, payment issues, and account management.

Real-time Data Integration: Using retrieval-augmented generation, the system accesses live databases to provide up-to-date information about orders, inventory, and customer accounts.

Scalable Architecture: Built to handle multiple concurrent conversations while maintaining low latency and high accuracy in response generation.

Technical Innovation
The project showcases advanced implementation of tokenization, transformer layers, and self-attention mechanisms to understand customer intent and context. The system employs a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle different conversation stages, from initial greetings to complex issue resolution.

Performance Metrics: Early implementations have demonstrated significant improvements including 25% increase in sales conversion rates, 30% improvement in agent productivity, and 60% reduction in customer acquisition time.
